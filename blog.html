      <h2>Blog Description</h2>
      <p>Ok so hey, hi, and hello! <br><br>
        So yea, this is a "blog" but more like a journal (that just happens to be online). Yes, there may be times where I "pick a topic" and stick to it. And yes, there will most likely be times where there is sh!t like playlists, lists in general, how-to's, DIY ideas, sh!t i cooked/made (or want to cook/make), and all type of sh!t. <br><br>
        And yes, I will also (more than likely), at some point or another have posts what contain my opinions, feelings, thoughts, beliefs, whatever you would like to call them. I am not one that will judge others for their beliefs and/or opinions. I will not argue them in order to make them see or understand my viewpoints. I have my opinion and they have theirs. I am not one that believes that one person's view is any better than anothers because, each of us has our own thought processes creating our beliefs, usually based on things that have happened in our lives. I have not walked in your shoes just as you have not walked in mine. So I do not feel that I have any right to attempt to change your opinion, nor do you have any right to try and change mine. This is simply an outlet for me. I will not defend my thoughts to anyone and, if that is your reason for reading this, if there is any malicious intent what-so-ever, I kindly ask you to stop now and leave this site.<br><br>
        Having said that, I also will not hold back. I do talk a lot and I do ramble. Once I start the words just start to flow out of me whether speaking, writing, or typing. Many people, when writing, scale back, go back and edit, etc. I was actually thinking of how I was going to do this. However, I have since decided that I am not going to do any of that. If I am honestly creating this as an outlet for me then, I should not have to edit, or censor, or anything like this. So I am not. I am going to be 100% me and, again, if you do not like this I beg of you to leave this page now. PSA I will hold no ill will, I will not be offended in the least, have no worries my life shall go on.<br><br>
        Also, I shall insert here that I cuss like a sailor at times, sometimes I speak proper and as an intellectual may, while at others it just is what it is. Again, if you cannot deal with this, and deal with it in a respectful manor, please have a great life and don't let the virtual door hit ya in the a$$ on the way off my page. I totally understand that I will not be everyone's cup of tea(or in my case coffee) and I do not have any problems with that at all, there are many people I don't vibe with either. However,  I do demand respect.
